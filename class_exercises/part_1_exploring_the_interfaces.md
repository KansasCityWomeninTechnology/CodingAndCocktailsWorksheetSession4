### Part 1: Exploring the Interfaces {#part-1-exploring-the-interfaces}

1.  If you use Windows, open Git Bash, or if you use a Mac, open iTerm2, which is your command line tool. Note that it accepts typed commands we covered covered last month. For a refresher, check out the session here: [http://bit.ly/cmdln](http://bit.ly/cmdln). Try these:
    1.  check your folder to see if you have a Coding &amp; Cocktails folder set up. If not, use command `mkdir` to build the folder.
    2.  `cd codingandcocktails`: changes the working directory to your Coding And Cocktails directory.
2.  Open the desktop app either by typing git gui on the command line, or using your search directory to find it on your machine. Click **Create New Repository**. This will bring up the GUI (graphical user interface), or “gooey”, which you may explore but we will not go into detail in class.
3.  Go to Github.com and log into your account. We will talk about various features of the GitHub page together.
