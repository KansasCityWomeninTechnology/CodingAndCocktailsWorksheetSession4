### Part 1: Exploring the Interfaces {#part-1-exploring-the-interfaces}

1.  If you use Windows, open Git Bash, or if you use a Mac, open iTerm2.

2.  Type `cd CodingAndCocktails` to navigate to your `CodingAndCocktails` directory in your home directory.

3. Type `mkdir VersionControl` to make a new folder for this month. Then type `cd VersionControl` to move into that folder.

    For a refresher on command line, check out the worksheet from last month: [bit.ly/CnCMarWork](http://bit.ly/CnCMarWork).
    {% endhint %}

3.  Type `mkdir FirstRepo` to make a repository inside your  VersionControl directory your directory structure should now look like this:
```
CodingAndCocktails
        |
        |--VersionControl
                |
                |--FirstRepo
```
4. Type `git gui`. This will open the GUI (Graphical User Interface) to interact with Git.

5. Click **Create New Repository** and **Browse** to your _FirstRepo_ directory and choose it.

6. Click **Create** This will turn _FirstRepo_ into a Git repository and bring up the GUI , which you may explore but we will not go into detail in class.

7. To return to the command line either quit out of Git GUI or in iTerm2 or Git Bash, press the `ctrl` + `c` buttons to return to your prompt.

8. In Google Chrome, navigate to [Github.com](github.com) and log into your account. Take a look around.  View your profile by selecting that option from the drop down menu in the upper right.  This will be more exciting to look at once we have a bit more GitHub interaction.
