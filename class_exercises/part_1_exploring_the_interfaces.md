### Part 1: Exploring the Interfaces {#part-1-exploring-the-interfaces}

1.  If you use Windows, open Git Bash, or if you use a Mac, open iTerm2.

2.  Type `cd CodingAndCocktails` to navigate to your `CodingAndCocktails` directory in your home directory.

3. Type `mkdir VersionControl` to make a new folder for this month. Then type `cd VersionControl` to move into that folder.

For a refresher on command line, check out the worksheet from last month: [bit.ly/CnCMarWork](http://bit.ly/CnCMarWork).
    {% endhint %}

3.  Type `mkdir GUIRepo` to make a new directory inside your  VersionControl directory. Your directory structure should now look like this:
```
CodingAndCocktails
        |
        |--VersionControl
                |
                |--GUIRepo
```
4. Type `git gui`. This will open the GUI (Graphical User Interface) to interact with Git.

5. Click **Create New Repository** and **Browse** to your _GUIRepo_ directory and choose it.

6. Click **Create** This will turn _GUIRepo_ into a Git repository and bring up the GUI , which you may explore but we will not go into detail in class.

7. To return to the command line either:
    a) Exit out of Git GUI the same way you exit out of any program, or 
    b) In iTerm2 or Git Bash, press the `ctrl` + `c` keys on your keyboard to return to your command prompt.
    
8. In Google Chrome, navigate to [Github.com](github.com) and log into your account. Take a look around.  View your profile by selecting that option from the drop down menu in the upper right.  This will be more exciting to look at once we have a bit more GitHub interaction.
