### Part 5: Forking {#part-5-practice-with-forking}

Forking is similar to cloning, but in the cloud - it creates a copy of another repository (that often belongs to someone else) and allows you to make changes without affecting the original repository.

1.  In Google Chrome, navigate to the Kansas City Women in Technology Learning Resources repository: [https://github.com/KansasCityWomeninTechnology/LearningResources](https://github.com/KansasCityWomeninTechnology/LearningResources) 

2.  Find the Fork button in the upper right corner of the page and click on it.

    {% hint style='danger' %}
If asked, “Where should we fork this repository?” Select your personal profile. This would indicate you're a part of a GitHub organization but we want to use our personal accounts this evening.  If you are not asked that question, carry on.
    {% endhint %}

3.  Once complete, it will open up your fork of the Learning Resources Repository.

5.  Clone this repository down to your desktop.
