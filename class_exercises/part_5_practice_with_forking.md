### Part 5: Forking {#part-5-practice-with-forking}

Forking is similar to cloning, but in the cloud. 

1.  In Google Chrome, navigate to the Kansas City Women in Technology Learning Resources repository: [https://github.com/KansasCityWomeninTechnology/LearningResources](https://github.com/KansasCityWomeninTechnology/LearningResources) 

2.  Find the Fork button in the upper right corner of the page and click on it.

{% hint style='danger' %}
If asked, “Where should we fork this repository?” Select your personal profile. This would indicate you're a part of a GitHub organization but we want to use our personal accounts this evening.  If you are not asked that question carry on.
{% endhint %}

4.  Once the repository is copied to your profile, it will open up the page dedicated to your fork of the Learning Resources Repository.

5.  Clone this repository down to your desktop. (_Hint: Review the steps for cloning a repository in Part 3)._

Once you have cloned it down to your desktop you can open this folder in Sublime text and add your own updates to any of the markdown documents. If you have a definition or a term you would like to see added, push the changes up to your forked repository (your _upstream)._ Once your commit has been saved in the cloud, use the green “pull request” button to submit a request to have someone review your code for possible inclusion in the main repository. If you don’t want to suggest a change, you can still treat it like any other project of yours and continue committing updates to your fork without ever pushing it back up to the KCWiT repository where it originated.

**Take a break! You’ve earned it!**
