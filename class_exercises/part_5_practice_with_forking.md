### Part 5: Practice with Forking {#part-5-practice-with-forking}

When **forking**, you are pulling a copy of someone else’s repository into your own local environment. You can review their code, modify it, and test it locally. If you have a suggestion, you can then push your updates to their code into the “upstream” repository (your cloud copy of their repo) and issue a _pull request_. You are asking the owner of the original repository to review your code and incorporate it into their master branch. _The key is, the owner of the original repo that you forked from is the one who gets to decide when and if to merge your code with theirs._

1.  Point your browser to the Kansas City Women in Technology GitHub Page: [https://github.com/KansasCityWomeninTechnology/LearningResources](https://github.com/KansasCityWomeninTechnology/LearningResources) (or type [http://bit.ly/kcwitLR](http://bit.ly/kcwitLR) if you printed this off)
2.  Look in the upper right corner of the page, near your profile photo for the “fork” Icon. Click this link.
3.  When asked, “Where should we fork this repository?” Select your own profile. If it does not show an option, don’t worry! It will fork the repository to your own account.
4.  Once the repository is copied to your profile, it will open up the page dedicated to your fork of the Learning Resources Repository.
5.  Clone this repository down to your desktop. (_Hint: Review the steps for cloning a repository in Part 3)._

Once you have cloned it down to your desktop you can open this folder in Sublime text and add your own updates to any of the markdown documents. If you have a definition or a term you would like to see added, push the changes up to your forked repository (your _upstream)._ Once your commit has been saved in the cloud, use the green “pull request” button to submit a request to have someone review your code for possible inclusion in the main repository. If you don’t want to suggest a change, you can still treat it like any other project of yours and continue committing updates to your fork without ever pushing it back up to the KCWiT repository where it originated.

**Take a break! You’ve earned it!**
