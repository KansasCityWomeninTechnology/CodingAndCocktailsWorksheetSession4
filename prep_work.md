## Prep Work {#prep-work}

**We strongly recommend that you do these steps prior to coming to the session.**

1.  Verify that you have a Github login and that Git is installed on your computer. If you do not have it, click on or type [http://bit.ly/cnctools](http://bit.ly/cnctools) to be redirected to our instructions for downloading developer tools.
2.  Open Git Bash (Windows) or iTerm2 (Macs). At the prompt ($ or &gt;), type: `git config --global user.name "Your Name"` (use your actual name) to set your user name. Be sure to use the quotation marks around your name. Remember to press &lt;enter&gt; after every command to execute it.
3.  At the next prompt, type: `git config --global user.email yourname@email.com` (use your actual email address) to set your email address. This is critical because you are setting up your login verification with GitHub. You will be asked for it every time you commit changes before pushing them up to Github. Weâ€™ll explain what that means in detail Saturday night.
4.  Finally, just to ensure that you have entered everything correctly, type `git config --list` to list all the settings Git can find at that point. Ensure that user.email and user.name are displayed in this list.
5.  While there are many Git command cheat sheet sites, we found this one particularly useful: [http://bit.ly/CnCGitCS](http://bit.ly/CnCGitCS). You may want to print this as well ahead of time and bring it with you for easier access during the session.
