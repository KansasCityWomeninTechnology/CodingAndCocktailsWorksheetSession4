Now you have a copy on GitHub, and a local copy that you can modify without affecting the remote until you tell it to.\n\nType cd MyFirstRepo to change directory into your repository. \n  The directory is named the same as what you named your repository when you created it so if you named it something else be sure to modify your cd command appropriately.\n\n\nIn Git Bash or iTerm2, type atom .  This will open the Atom text editor with the folder where you run that command in context.\nWe are going to make a simple change to the README.md file, in order to track the changes in the next section.\n\nIn Atom, in the left pane where the files are listed, double click on the README.md file.\n\nChange something in the file, such as adding a sentence, or a list of the ladies sitting around you tonight.

Let’s try it now.\n\nIn Git Bash or iTerm2, type git status.  This shows you what changes you have made to your code. You should see that your README.md file has changes: \n\nNotice it tells us these are \"Changes not staged for commit:\"\nIf you do not see any changes, double check that you saved your file in Atom.\n\nType git add README.md.\n\nTo verify that your files were added, type git status again. , which will tell you all about your repo. the last line will show which files have been modified.\n\n Notice this time it tells us these are \"Changes to be committed:\"\n\nIn Atom, make another change to your README.md file and save the changes.\n\nIn Git Bash or iTerm2, check your status again by typing git status.  This time it knows you already had changes ready to be committed AND you have some more changes that have not yet been staged. \n \n\nThis time,  type git add -A, to add all files you have modified since the last commit to the staging area.\n The capitalization of the A is important in this step.  A lowercase -a is not a command that Git recognizes by itself.\n\n\nDouble check yourself that everything is staged by typing git status.\n\nCommit your changes with a brief commit message by typing git commit -m \"Initial Commit\".\nThe -m flag allows you to provide a description of the changes. This is important information for those who may collaborate on the code later.\n\nYour changes have been committed and are ready to be pushed up to GitHub.\n\n\nType git push origin master to initiate the push.\n“origin” tells Git you are pushing the changes to the original remote location\n“master” indicates which branch within the remote location you'd like to push to.\n\n\n\nVoila! You have pushed your first revision to GitHub!\n"},"class_exercises/part_5_practice_with_forking.html":{"url":"class_exercises/part_5_practice_with_forking.html","title":"Part 5: Forking","keywords":"","body":"Part 5: Forking \nForking is similar to cloning, but in the cloud - it creates a copy of another repository (that often belongs to someone else) and allows you to make changes without affecting the original repository.\n\nIn Google Chrome, navigate to the Kansas City Women in Technology Learning Resources repository: https://github.com/KansasCityWomeninTechnology/LearningResources \n\nFind the Fork button in the upper right corner of the page and click on it.\n\nIf asked, “Where should we fork this repository?” Select your personal profile.

Replacing the angle brackets and text \"your GitHub Username\" with your actual GitHub username, leaving the @ symbol. Make note of the issue number to use in step 7. \n\nFork the repository.\n If you need a refresher on how to fork a repository go back to Part 5: Forking.\n\n\nIn Git Bash or iTerm2 you are probably still in the MyFirstRepo directory from step 4. If so, type cd .. to navigate back up to your VersionControl directory.  If you are anywhere else change directories to the VersionControl directory.\n\nClone the repository and cd into it.\n\nUse the issue number from step 4, make a new branch. In Git Bash or iTerm2, type git checkout -b issue-## to do this.\n If you are working on issue #4, your branch name would be issue-04.\n\n\nTo view all branches within the repo, type git branch . This should show you at least two branches - master, and the issue-## branch you just created. The branch you are currently working in will be highlighted with an asterisk (*).\n To switch between branches type git checkout  replacing the angle brackets and the text \"branchname\" with the branch you'd like to switch to.  For example if you want to switch to the \"development\" branch you'd type git checkout development.\n\n\nIn Git Bash or iTerm2 type atom .. This will open your Atom text editor with the context of the current directory.\n\nMake changes to the application as instructed in your issue and make sure to save any files you change. \n\nAfter you've saved your files, in Git Bash or iTerm2, type git status to view which files you've changed. \n\nIf everything looks good, stage and commit your changes. Type git push origin  to push to the branch you made to your remote fork, substituting your own branch name for the angle brackets and \"branchname\" text. Now you have pushed your changes to the origin (that is, to the cloud), to your specific branch.\n\nCreate a pull request to migrate your changes from the fork and branch you have been working on to the Kansas City Women in Technology repository.\n\nIn Google Chrome, navigate to https://github.com/KansasCityWomeninTechnology/DrinkOrderApp and click on the New Pull Request button.\n\n\nClick the \"compare across forks\" link at the end of the text \"Compare changes across branches, commits, tags, and more below. If you need to, you can also compare across forks.\"\n\nKeep the \"base fork\" (organization where you are moving your changes TO) as KansasCityWomeninTechnology \n\nChange the \"base\" (the branch within the organization you selected to move your changes TO) as \"vc-final\".\n\n\nChange the \"head fork\" (User that you're moving changes FROM) to yourGitHubusername/DrinkOrderApp \n\nChange the \"compare\" to the issue-## branch you created in step 7.\nFeel free to add any comments you'd like.  If you keep scrolling down you'll see the commits you added to make the change along with the diff across the file(s) you changed.\n\nClick on the Green \"Create pull request\" button.\nIf Git detects no conflicts, it will give you a checkmarked message saying “able to merge.”\nIf Git detects conflicts, it will display a red message saying \"Can't automatically merge.\"\n\n\n\n\nTypically someone or a group of people have oversight into merging the pull requests into the upstream repository (where you forked from) to become the final version of the code. Once your pull request is accepted by this person, you can view your code in the final destination, along with all of the changes your peers have made.\nWe will work on getting PR's (aka Pull Requests) merged as we are able!\n\n\nCongratulations!
