This time it knows you already had changes ready to be committed AND you have some more changes that have not yet been staged. \n \n\nThis time,  type git add -A, to add all files you have modified since the last commit to the staging area.\n The capitalization of the A is important in this step.  A lowercase -a is not a command that Git recognizes by itself.\n\n\nDouble check yourself that everything is staged by typing git status.\n\nCommit your changes with a brief commit message by typing git commit -m \"Updated README.md to practice staging, committing, and pushing.\".\nThe -m flag allows you to provide a description of the changes. This is important information for those who may collaborate on the code later.\n\nYour changes have been committed and are ready to be pushed up to GitHub.\n\n\nType git push origin master to initiate the push.\n“origin” tells Git you are pushing the changes to the original remote location.\n“master” indicates which branch within the remote location you'd like to push to.\n\n\n\nVoila!

For example,  \"This issue is assigned to @codingandcocktails.\" Replace codingandcocktails with your own GitHub username, leaving the @ symbol to tag yourself. Make note of the issue number to use in step 8. \n You may see development teams assign work via the \"Assignee\" option on the upper right corner of the issue.\n\nWe are not using that option to simplify user management tonight.\n\n\nFork the repository.\n If you need a refresher on how to fork a repository go back to Part 5: Forking.\n\n\nIn Git Bash or iTerm2 make sure you are in your VersionControl directory.  If you are anywhere else change directories to the VersionControl directory.\n\nClone the forked repository and cd into it.\n\nUsing the issue number from step 4, we will now make a new branch. In Git Bash or iTerm2, type git checkout -b issue-## to do this replacing ## with your issue number.\n If you are working on issue #9, your branch name would be issue-09.\n\n\nTo view all branches within the repo, type git branch . This should show you at least two branches - master, and the issue-## branch you just created. The branch you are currently working in will be highlighted with an asterisk (*).\n To switch between branches type git checkout branchname replacing the text \"branchname\" with the branch you'd like to switch to.  For example if you want to switch to the \"development\" branch you'd type git checkout development.\n\n\nIn Git Bash or iTerm2 type atom .. This will open your Atom text editor with the context of the current directory.\n\nMake changes to the application as instructed in your issue and make sure to save any files you change. \n\nAfter you've saved your files, in Git Bash or iTerm2, type git status to view which files you've changed. \n\nIf everything looks good, stage and commit your changes. Type git push origin  to push to the branch you made to your remote fork, substituting your own branch name for the angle brackets and \"branchname\" text. Now you have pushed your changes to the origin (that is, to the cloud), to your specific branch.\n\nCreate a pull request to migrate your changes from the fork and branch you have been working on to the Kansas City Women in Technology repository.\n\nIn Google Chrome, navigate to https://github.com/KansasCityWomeninTechnology/DrinkOrderApp and click on the New Pull Request button.\n\n\nClick the \"compare across forks\" link at the end of the text \"Compare changes across branches, commits, tags, and more below. If you need to, you can also compare across forks.\"\n\nKeep the \"base fork\" (organization where you are moving your changes TO) as KansasCityWomeninTechnology \n\nChange the \"base\" (the branch within the organization you selected to move your changes TO) as \"vc-final\".\n\n\nChange the \"head fork\" (User that you're moving changes FROM) to yourGitHubusername/DrinkOrderApp \n\nChange the \"compare\" to the issue-## branch you created in step 7.\nFeel free to add any comments you'd like.  If you keep scrolling down you'll see the commits you added to make the change along with the diff across the file(s) you changed.\n\nClick on the Green \"Create pull request\" button.\nIf Git detects no conflicts, it will give you a checkmarked message saying “able to merge.”\nIf Git detects conflicts, it will display a red message saying \"Can't automatically merge.\"\n\n\n\n\nTypically someone or a group of people have oversight into merging the pull requests into the upstream repository (where you forked from) to become the final version of the code. Once your pull request is accepted by this person, you can view your code in the final destination, along with all of the changes your peers have made.\nWe will work on getting PR's (aka Pull Requests) merged as we are able!\n\n\nCongratulations!

Type cd ~/CodingAndCocktails/VersionControl/LearningResources.\n\nConfigure your upstream remote (where you forked from).\n\nType git remote -v to view the currently configured remotes.\n\n\nSpecify your upstream remote by typing git remote add upstream https://github.com/KansasCityWomeninTechnology/LearningResources.git\n\nDouble check you have a new remote configured by typing git remote -v again.  This time you should see both origin remotes and upstream remotes. \n\n\n\n\nFetch any new commits to the upstream repository. Type git fetch upstream.\n\nMerge changes from upstream/master into your local branch.  Type git merge upstream/master to sync with the upstream repository without losing any local changes that you may have made.  You should now be up to date with any changes that have been committed and merged into the upstream repository since you forked the repository.\nThis sync only updated your local copy of the repository. To update your fork on GitHub, you must push your changes to your origin remote.\n\n\nOpen and update the glossary.md markdown document to add your term.\nNever used markdown before and need some help figuring it out? \nCheck out these resources:\n    1.
