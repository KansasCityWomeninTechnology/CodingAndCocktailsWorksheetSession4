# Creating a repository and commit changes {#top}
We'll create our own repository and commit changes to source files. At the end we'll build something similar to the "DrinkOrderApp" with commits and branches.

This section will help guide you through the following steps:

{% include "./instruction-steps.html" %}

## Create a repository in GitHub and clone {#create} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
We'll create our first repository on GitHub and clone it so that we're prepared to start making changes.
{% include "./1create.md" %}

## Add a new file and check status {#add} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
Now that we've cloned, we can start making changes. Let's practice by adding a file and learn about the command `git status`.
{% include "./2add.md" %}

## Stage your file and commit your changes {#commit} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
Our file is ready to go! Let's stage and commit our changes.
{% include "./3commit.md" %}
