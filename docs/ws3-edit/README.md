# Editing files and push changes {#top}
Now we'll see the power of version control by editing files, looking at differences between the revisions, and pushing our changes up to GitHub.

This section will help guide you through the following steps:

{% include "./instruction-steps.html" %}

## Edit files and look at changes {#diff} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
Let's make some more changes and compare differences.
{% include "./1diff.md" %}

## Resetting a change {#reset} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
Sometimes we change our minds and decide we no longer want a change. We'll learn how to reset a file back to the last commit. 
{% include "./2reset.md" %}

## Pushing our changes to GitHub {#push} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
Finally, perfection! Let's push those changes up to remote, in our case, GitHub.
{% include "./3push.md" %}
