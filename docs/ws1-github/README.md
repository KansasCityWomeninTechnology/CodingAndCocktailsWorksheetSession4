{% hint style='danger' %}If you are using a Chromebook, please skip to the <a href="#chromebook-instructions">Chromebook instructions</a> below!
{% endhint %}

## Create and link the stylesheet to the HTML {#link-stylesheet} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
{% include "./1create-css.md" %}

## Resize images using relative and absolute sizes {#sizes} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
Images are a big part of any website and what most people see first because your eyes are drawn to visuals. Letâ€™s learn about absolute and relative sizing and apply it to the images in the menu.
{% include "./2resize-images.md" %}

## Change the color of the title {#text-color} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
Color helps differentiate sections within a website and helps convey importance. In this section we'll change the color of the "LadyDev Bar & Grill" title.
{% include "./3title-color.md" %}

## Cascade background color changes {#cascade} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
The ability to cascade styles makes CSS powerful. In this section we will apply background colors to demonstrate how to cascade styles.
{% include "./4background-color.md" %}

## Checkpoint <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
Compare your _styles.css_ against the answer key for your work so far. It might look a little different depending on the color palette you chose.  
{% include "./checkpoint.html" %}
