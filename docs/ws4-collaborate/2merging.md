1. Check the graph by typing `git log --graph` <i class="fa fa-share fa-rotate-180"></i>. It doesn't look right. Your 2 branches diverged. Now there is a change in 'master' that your 'cocktails-branch' doesn't know about. Your changes for both branches now looks like the picture below but the terminal doesn't reflect this.

1. There's another parameter we can add to the `git log` command to see the graph for all branches. Type `git log --graph --all` <i class="fa fa-share fa-rotate-180"></i>.

1. We want to bring our changes in the 'cocktails-branch' into 'master' by creating a pull request. Before we do so, we should reconcile the differences in branches. Checkout 'cocktails-branch'.

1. Open Atom and take a look at _README.md_. It now contains the sentence you added in the beginning of this section.

1. We created a merge commit in 'cocktails-branch' to bring in code from 'master'. In the terminal, take a look at the git graph. We see the path now includes 'master' branch. Your graph now looks like this
