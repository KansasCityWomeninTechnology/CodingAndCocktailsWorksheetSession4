# Collaborating with others {#top}
The ability to make and reset changes is cool, but the real power behind version control is the ability to collaborate with others.

This section will help guide you through the following steps:

{% include "./instruction-steps.html" %}

## Create a branch {#branch} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
We've been making changes to the default master branch, but most of the time you'll want to keep code work separated in branches. Let's create a branch and make some changes.
{% include "./1branch.md" %}

## Merge master to your branch {#merge} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
We have differences between the branches. We want to make sure we have the latest changes in our current branch.
{% include "./2merging.md" %}

## Merge your branch to master by creating a pull request {#pull-request} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
Our changes are ready to go. Let's create a pull request to merge our changes back to master. 
{% include "./3pull-request.md" %}

## Forking {#fork} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
What if you want to make a change in another repository that doesn't belong to you? You can create a fork of it. 
{% include "./4fork.md" %}
