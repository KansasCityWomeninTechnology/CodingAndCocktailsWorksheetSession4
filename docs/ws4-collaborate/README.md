This section will help guide you through the following steps:

{% include "./instruction-steps.html" %}

## Create a branch {#branch} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
We've been making changes to master, but most of the time you'll want to keep code work separated in branches. Let's create a branch and make some changes.
{% include "./1branch.md" %}

## Merge your branch to master by creating a pull request {#pull-request} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
Our changes are ready to go. Let's create a pull request to merge our changes back to master. 
{% include "./2pull-request.md" %}

## Forking {#fork} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
What if you want to make a change in another repository that doesn't belong to you? You can create a fork of it. 
{% include "./3fork.md" %}
