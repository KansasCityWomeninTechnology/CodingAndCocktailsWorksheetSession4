Tonight we'll use [Codenvy](https://codenvy.com/)-- an online development environment. We will be able to follow along with the worksheet except you will not have access to GitKraken or vim. Specific deviations from the instructions for Chromebook users are called out in the worksheet steps.

### Requirements
1. A GitHub account. If you don't have a GitHub account, follow the instructions to [Create a GitHub account](https://codingandcocktailskc.gitbooks.io/coding-cocktails-the-tools/content/tools-git/#create-a-github-account).

### Codenvy instructions
1. Using Chrome, [create a Codenvy account](https://codenvy.io/site/login?redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcodenvy.io%2F) by using your GitHub account. It will ask you for your name, company (put in "None" or anything you like), and role (use Hobbyist).

1. You will be navigated to the Dashboard. Click **Create Workspace** button in the **Recent Workspaces** section. 

1. On the New Workspace page, in the **NAME** section name your workspace "CodingAndCocktailsWork".

1. In the **SELECT STACK** section, scroll down and select **Node**.

1. Click the green **CREATE** button at the bottom of the page. It will take a 30 seconds or so to create your workspace and start your dev-machine.

1. The "CodingAndCocktailsWork" workspace now opens. Refer to the image below for workspace layout.

1. Click in the terminal window to give it focus and type `pwd`. This is your home directory. Any time you see instructions to navigate to home directory, use `/projects`.

1. In the terminal type `mkdir CodingAndCocktails` and press `Enter` to create the "CodingAndCocktails" folder. You are now ready to follow tonight's session work.

{% hint style='danger' %}
Codenvy will stop your workspace if you are idle for too long. Restart your workspace if this happens. You may have to navigate back to the directory you were working in.
