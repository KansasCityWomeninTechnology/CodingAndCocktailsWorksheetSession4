# Bonus - Resolve a merge conflict
Merge conflicts may not happen as often, but eventually you will run into one. View the video below to see a merge conflict and resolving it in action. We will not practice this here but this is a skill that you can expect to training on according to your teamâ€™s procedures.

If you want to try this yourself, you need to make an edit to the same file (add a new line at the end of ReadMe) on two separate branches and merge. 

Reach out on Slack so a mentor can help you recreate a merge conflict scenario to practice on.
