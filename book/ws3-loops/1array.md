1. Place your cursor between the opening and closing square brackets and press `Enter`. Type `"JavaScript Types"`. 
   {% hint style='info' %}
You added an element to the array. Your array now has a length of 1.
   {% endhint %}  

1. Inside the `document.addEventListener` method, add a `console.log` to log out the array. What do you see in DevTools when you reload the webpage?

1. Arrays have built in properties. One property of an array is the length. Let's change our `console.log` above to log out the length of the array by using `brainSkills.length`. What do you see in DevTools when you reload the webpage?

1. Add more skills you learned at Coding & Cocktails or about coding tonight to the array by comma separating values. Your `brainSkills` array might look something like this:
   ```js
   const brainSkills = [
      "Front-End Architecture",
      "HTML",
      "CSS",
      "Command line operations",
      "Vim",
      "Git",
      "JavaScript Types"
   ];
   ```
   {% hint style='working' %}
What is your array length now?
   {% endhint %}
